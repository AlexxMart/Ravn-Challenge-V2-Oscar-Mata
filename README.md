# RAVN CODING CHALLENGE

Here you will find the complete coding challenge both for web and react native.

Both cases use ApolloClient to consume the GraphQL API.

There are some similarities in the code structure and the dependencies used for both projects to show the advantage of using React in both ends and demonstrate that sharing a common structure and/or hooks can reduce the amount of time needed to complete a web and mobile solution to a client.

### Notes:

- Each directory contains a README with the details on how to start the project and run it locally.
- There is a section to explain the technologies used to make the projects possible and some technicals desitions I took to make it easier for you to review this work and test it.
