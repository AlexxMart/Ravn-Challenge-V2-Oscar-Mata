## Assumptions

- Since the site is an SPA I didn't include any routing library.
- Used a custom spinner instead of the "loading" text.
- Added a "helpers" folder to add variables and media queries even though are not used for this instance of the project, but are ready in case they need to be integrated with SASS.

## Technologies Used

- React
- Apollo Client
- GraphQL
- SCSS
